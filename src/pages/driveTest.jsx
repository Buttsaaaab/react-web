      <h1>Class A manual transmission restriction</h1>
      <p>As of July 1, 2022, you must complete your Class A or Class A restricted (AR) road test in a 
vehicle with a manual transmission that consists of at least eight forward gears with a high-low 
range or you will get a restriction on your licence. If you have a restriction, you cannot operate 
Class A/ARvehicles with a manual transmission in Ontario. You can only operate automatic, 
semi-automatic or automated-manual transmission Class A/AR vehicles.</p>

      {/* Other sections omitted for brevity */}


      <p>

      A motor vehicle is considered to have a manual transmission if it has:
 a driver-operated clutch that is activated by a pedal or lever
 a driver operated gear-shift mechanism (operated by hand or foot and does not use the 
assistance of automation)
The restriction will be noted on your driver record and driver’s licence. It will not apply when 
operating lower-class vehicles such as Class G or D.
This restriction does not apply to anyone who completed their Class A/AR road test before 
July 1, 2022.



      </p>

      <h1>Getting a Restricted Class A licence</h1>

      <p>You do not have to complete mandatory entry-level training to get a Restricted Class A 
(AR) licence. If you want to upgrade from an AR to a full Class A licence, you will have to 
complete the training at that time and take a road test in a full Class A vehicle.
As of July 1, 2022, the type of transmission in the vehicle you use for your road test will 
determine what types of Class AR vehicles you can drive in Ontario.</p>

<h1>Class D licence</h1>
<p>A Class D licence lets you drive:
 a truck with a gross weight or registered gross weight of more than 
11,000 kg (24,000 lbs)
 any truck or truck and towed vehicle combination of more than 11,000 kg (24,000 lbs) 
gross weight or registered gross weight, provided the towed vehicle is not over 
4,600 kg (10,000 lbs). If the towed vehicle weighs more than 4,600 kg, you will need 
either a full Class A or restricted Class A licence.
With a Class D licence, you can also drive a car or light truck covered by a G Class licence.
